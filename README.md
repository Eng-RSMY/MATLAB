Simple Image Processing Projects using MATLAB

This Repository has two simple Projects done using MATLAB.

The first project (Image Filters) lets us select one of the 4 specified filters and apply it on any given input image and see the result.
It is done using the concept of histogram matching.


The second project of Steganography allows us to choose 2 images (of same dimensions, as per the limitation of this project) and hide one inside the other.
This is done by Extracting few MSB's from the image to be hidden and replace the LSB's of the input image with it. 
The project also allows us to retrieve the hidden image from the encrypted image.
